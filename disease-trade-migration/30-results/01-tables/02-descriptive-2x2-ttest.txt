T-test : among NON-Pepfar recipients, is the difference in the change in HIV incidence rate per 100k (hiv incidence first-diff.) statistically significantly different between countries with High or Low trade with PEPFAR recipients? T-test result:

	Welch Two Sample t-test

data:  tradeTest$ihme_hiv100kFd by tradeTest$class
t = -4.5, df = 1531, p-value = 0.000009
alternative hypothesis: true difference in means between group PEPFAR Trade - High and group PEPFAR Trade - Low is not equal to 0
95 percent confidence interval:
 -1.6018 -0.6229
sample estimates:
mean in group PEPFAR Trade - High  mean in group PEPFAR Trade - Low 
                          -1.5240                           -0.4117 



Among non-PEPFAR recipients, HIV incidence decreased faster in countries with HIGH trade with PEPFAR recipients (mean high: -1.524) than in countries with LOW trade with PEPFAR recipients (mean low: -0.412).

The mean difference in HIV incidence reduction between Non-PEPFAR recipients who had high trade with PEPFAR recipients and those with low trade with PEPFAR recipieints is -1.103 [95% ci: -1.58, -0.634]

Correlation between HIV incidence rate change (first diff.) and PEPFAR trade percent:
